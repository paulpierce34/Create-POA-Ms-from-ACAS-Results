# Create-POA&Ms-from-ACAS-Results

The purpose of this script is to convert your ACAS vulnerability scan results file into a Plan of Actions and Milestones (POA&M) formatted output file.

If you've ever seen the extent of ACAS scan results and how long it takes to transfer these to a POA&M file manually, this script is for you.

REQUIREMENTS:
- An ACAS results .csv file
- A POA&M templated excel file
- Powershell

HOW TO USE:

1.) Execute script

2.) You will be prompted for a name for your output file, type filename (no extension) and then press Enter to continue

3.) Script will then create an output .csv file and write to host file location

4.) Open this output file, copy all of the contents (besides the headers)

5.) Open your POA&M templated excel file

6.) Paste copied contents into POA&M templated file


You now have a POA&M created from ACAS results! This is great for keeping up to date monthly and maintaining a proactive security posture.
